# SMALL-COMPUTER-SIMULATION-IN-FORTRAN-SMAC-
THIS IS A FORTRAN 95 PROGRAM FILE OF SIMULATION OF A COMPUTER LIKE MICROPROCESSOR 8085...JUST DOWNLOAD THE FILE AND COMPILE IT AND PROGRAM IT BY SIMPLE  BELOW COMMAND

HERE OP CODE IS TWO DIGIT NUMBER AND THEY ARE
01 CLEAR ACCUMULATOR AND TRANSFER THE CONTENT OF MEMORY TO ACCUMULATOR
02 ADD CONTENT OF MEMORY TO THE ACCUMULATOR
03 SUBTRACT THE CONTENT OF MEMORY FROM ACCUMULATOR
04 MULTIPLY WITH CONTENT OF MEMORY TO THE ACCUMULATOR
05 DIVIDE ACCUMULATOR WITH CONTENT OF MEMORY
06 STORE THE ACCUMULATOR IN MEMORY
07 TAKE NEXT INSTRUCTION FROM SPECIFIED MEMORY LOCATION
08 TRANSFER TO THE SPECIFIED MEMORY LOCATION IF ACCUMULATOR CONTENT IS NEGATIVE,OTHERWISE GO TO THE NEXT INSTRUCTION IN SEQUENCE
09 TAKE DATA FROM STANDARD INPUT AND STORE IN THE SPECIFIED MEMORY LOCATION
10 PRINT THE CONTENT OF SPECIFIED LOCATION
11 STOP EXECUTING PROGRAM ADDRESS PART NOT USED

HERE IN THIS PROGRAM WE ARE USING 1000 MEMORY LOCATION I.E 1K MEMORY SO WE CAN SPECIFY MEMORY LOCATION BY 000 TO 999.

#NOW HERE I GIVING A EXAMPLE TO MAKE A PROGRAM WHICH CAN PRINT OUT THE BIG NUMBER WITH COMPARISON OF 


NOW ENTER YOUR MACHINE CODE FOLLOWING WAY
 MEMORY_LOCATION_WITH_THREE_DIGIT,TWO SPACE,OP_CODE_WITH_TWO_DIGIT,TWO_SPACE,MEMORY_ADDRESS_WITH_THREE_DIGIT

 PROGRAM TERMINATES NORMALLY
